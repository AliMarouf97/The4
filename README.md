# The4
The Connect 4 Board Game, Implemented in Standard C++ Console and Qt GUI C++.


## Rules
The rules of The Connect 4 Game are simple. The first player who connects four of his colored checker pieces in a row "``horizontally``, ``vertically``, or ``diagonally``" is the winner, much the same as tic tac toe.
Each player will drop in one checker piece at a time.
